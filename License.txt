This model is adapted from the Alpha Simulations Sea Fury model.


TO USE:

This model is adapted for use with the FlightGear open-source
flight simulator.  To that end, the original model was
converted from MDL to AC3D format, and the texture were
converted from BMP to RGB (SGI) format.  The animations are
done using FlightGear's XML-based animation format.  The JSBSim
flight model is adapted from a FW-190 model which was produced by
Aeromatic and David Culp (see http://jsbsim.sourceforge.net/).
